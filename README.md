:wave: Hi everyone, my name is Alex Peluso an I enjoy creating good looking and accessible websites and web-apps. 
I am passionate about everything that is tech since I was a kid, when I started to take my first steps in this world using my father's computer to play videogames with him.

:books: In 2021, after working in other fields, I decided to start studying something that i really like and try to transform my biggest passion into my job.
I always liked the development world but I never really got into it until that time and I found out that this was the best fit for me. 

:hammer_and_wrench: I love the feeling of building something useful and accessible at the same time and I got addicted to finding creative solutions and problem solving. 

:computer: Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been studying and using recently:

- HTML & CSS
- Javascript (ES6+)
- React
- React native
- Typescript 
- Node.js
- Next.js
- express
- MongoDB
