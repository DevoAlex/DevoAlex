   Hi! My name is Alex and I enjoy creating Websites and apps. I'm a tech enthusiast since I was a kid and in december 2021 I decided to start my adventure into coding,
   trying to turn my biggest passion into my job.
   I started from web developing with HTML & CSS and currently I am studying JavaScript.
